# SE577-week-1

Hi Brian and Sean!
I am Ramesh Bheemappa. I work for Xfinity Prepaid team in Comcast leading most of the backend activities of the Product. 
I look forward to grasp good understanding the concepts involved in the Software Architecture. I need to discover how my current
experience and skills can be related to the field Architecture if there are any and develop on them to have a clear career path.
